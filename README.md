# Stoat

A tiny, energetic game engine. Loves to do the weasel war dance.

## About

Stoat is a prototype game engine used to test new ideas for [melonJS](http://www.melonjs.org/). It started as a weekend project to help us clean up the growing code base.

The project is named after the [weasel family](https://www.google.com/search?q=stoat&tbm=isch); *stoat* was chosen for its brevity and because *otter*, *ferret*, and *weasel* were already taken. :disappointed: *Ermine* was also available, but is one letter longer!
